Mission Statement

Coffee Shop Blogs aims to create an intimate, blogging community. It assigns members to a coffee shop where they are only able to read and interact with blogs by other members of that coffee shop and write blogs for only these members. Modern blogging sites can be overwhelming where every blog is at once available to every member. This creates an atmosphere of disinterest for community, the relationship between bloggers, and a respect for one's thoughts and writing. On a practical note, this also makes it hard for one's blogs to be noticed and networks are difficult to establish. Coffee Shop Blogs aims to solve these issues, particularly the first one, by encouraging an intimate community.
